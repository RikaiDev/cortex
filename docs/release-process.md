# 🚀 Release Process - Zero Patch Guarantee

## 🎯 Mission: Never Release Another Patch

Our release process is designed to **eliminate patch releases entirely** by catching issues before they reach production.

## 📋 Pre-Release Checklist

### 🔍 Automated Quality Gates

#### 1. Dependency Validation (`npm run release:deps`)

```bash
✅ Ensures NO runtime dependencies in devDependencies
✅ Scans for problematic imports (typescript, etc.)
✅ Validates critical runtime packages are in correct location
```

#### 2. Build Process (`npm run build`)

```bash
✅ Dependency check (automatic)
✅ ESLint validation
✅ TypeScript compilation
✅ Executable permissions
```

#### 3. Comprehensive Testing (`npm run test:all`)

```bash
✅ Unit tests for all components
✅ CLI integration tests
✅ MCP server integration tests
```

#### 4. Release Quality Check (`npm run release:check`)

```bash
✅ Git status cleanliness
✅ TypeScript compilation
✅ Lint validation
✅ Runtime dependency verification
✅ Global installation simulation
✅ CLI functionality test
✅ MCP server readiness
✅ File structure validation
✅ Version consistency
✅ Security audit
```

## 🚀 Release Commands

### For Current Version (Bug Fixes Only)

```bash
npm run release:current
```

- Uses existing version number
- Perfect for documentation fixes, typo corrections
- No version bump needed

### For New Features

```bash
npm run release:minor  # 0.8.0 → 0.9.0
npm run release:major  # 0.8.0 → 1.0.0
```

### Dry Run (Test Release Process)

```bash
npm run release:dry-run
```

- Runs all checks without publishing
- Perfect for validating release readiness

## 🛡️ Zero Patch Guarantee Mechanisms

### 1. **Dependency Gatekeeper**

- **What**: Scans source code for runtime imports
- **Why**: Prevents typescript-in-devDependencies disasters
- **When**: Every build, every release check

### 2. **Global Installation Simulation**

- **What**: Actually installs package globally in temp directory
- **Why**: Catches missing dependencies in real installation
- **When**: Every release check

### 3. **Version Consistency Validator**

- **What**: Cross-references package.json, CHANGELOG.md, git tags
- **Why**: Prevents version mismatches
- **When**: Every release check

### 4. **Build-Time Dependency Check**

- **What**: Validates dependencies before TypeScript compilation
- **Why**: Fails fast if dependencies are wrong
- **When**: Every build

## 📊 Quality Metrics

## 🚨 Emergency Procedures

### If Something Goes Wrong

#### Unpublish (Within 24 hours only)

```bash
npm run release:unpublish 0.8.1
```

#### Hotfix Process

```bash
# 1. Fix the issue
git add .
git commit -m "fix: critical hotfix for production issue"

# 2. Create patch version
npm run release:patch

# 3. This creates 0.8.1 automatically
```

## 📈 Continuous Improvement
