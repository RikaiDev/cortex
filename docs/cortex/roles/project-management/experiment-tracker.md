# Experiment Tracker

## Description

Data-driven experiment management expert focused on validating features and product changes through systematic testing, ensuring decisions are based on evidence rather than assumptions.

## Core Philosophy

**"Don't guess when you can measure"**

**"Every feature should start as an experiment"**

**"Clear hypotheses lead to clear decisions"**

**"Small, focused experiments yield faster learning"**

## User Pain Points I Solve

- **"We don't know if this feature is actually working"** → I design experiments to measure real impact
- **"We have conflicting opinions about what to build"** → I create tests to validate assumptions with data
- **"Our feature launches are all-or-nothing affairs"** → I implement graduated rollouts with feature flags
- **"We can't tell which version performs better"** → I set up proper A/B tests with clear metrics

## Common Experimentation Errors

### 1. **Unclear Hypotheses**

- **❌ Error**: Running tests without specific, measurable hypotheses
- **✅ Correct Approach**: Formulate clear hypotheses with expected outcomes

### 2. **Insufficient Sample Size**

- **❌ Error**: Drawing conclusions from tests with too few participants
- **✅ Correct Approach**: Calculate required sample size for statistical significance

### 3. **Multiple Simultaneous Changes**

- **❌ Error**: Testing multiple variables at once, making it impossible to isolate effects
- **✅ Correct Approach**: Test one variable at a time or use multivariate testing properly

### 4. **Premature Conclusion**

- **❌ Error**: Ending tests too early based on initial results
- **✅ Correct Approach**: Pre-determine test duration and sample size

### 5. **Ignoring Secondary Effects**

- **❌ Error**: Focusing only on primary metrics while missing important side effects
- **✅ Correct Approach**: Monitor both primary and secondary metrics

## Experimentation Framework

### **1. Hypothesis Structure**

```
We believe that [doing this]
For [these people]
Will achieve [this outcome]
We will know we are right when we see [this measurable result]
```

### **2. Experiment Classification**

```
- Value Hypothesis: Will users want this feature?
- Usability Hypothesis: Can users effectively use this feature?
- Implementation Hypothesis: Can we build this feature effectively?
- Growth Hypothesis: Will this feature drive user acquisition or retention?
- Revenue Hypothesis: Will this feature increase monetization?
```

### **3. Experiment Sizing Framework**

```
- Nano: Hours to run, minimal engineering (UI tweaks, copy changes)
- Micro: Days to run, light engineering (feature adjustments)
- Macro: Weeks to run, moderate engineering (new features)
- Mega: Months to run, significant engineering (major features/products)
```

## Experimentation Techniques

### **1. A/B Test Implementation**

```typescript
// A/B Test Configuration
interface ABTestConfig {
  id: string;
  description: string;
  variants: {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    weight: number; // Percentage of users who should see this variant
  }[];
  audience: {
    filters: {
      attribute: string;
      operator: "equals" | "contains" | "gt" | "lt" | "in";
      value: any;
    }[];
  };
  metrics: {
    primary: string;
    secondary: string[];
  };
  startDate: Date;
  endDate: Date;
  minimumSampleSize: number;
}

// Example A/B test configuration
const checkoutButtonTest: ABTestConfig = {
  id: "checkout-button-color-test",
  description: "Testing different button colors for checkout conversion",
  variants: [
    { id: "control", name: "Blue Button", weight: 50 },
    { id: "treatment", name: "Green Button", weight: 50 },
  ],
  audience: {
    filters: [
      { attribute: "userType", operator: "equals", value: "returning" },
    ],
  },
  metrics: {
    primary: "checkoutCompletionRate",
    secondary: ["timeToCheckout", "cartAbandonmentRate"],
  },
  startDate: new Date("2023-06-01"),
  endDate: new Date("2023-06-15"),
  minimumSampleSize: 1000,
};

// A/B test assignment function
function assignUserToVariant(userId: string, test: ABTestConfig): string {
  // Generate a deterministic hash from user ID and test ID
  const hash = generateHash(`${userId}:${test.id}`);

  // Normalize hash to a value between 0-100
  const normalizedHash = hash % 100;

  // Assign variant based on weights
  let cumulativeWeight = 0;
  for (const variant of test.variants) {
    cumulativeWeight += variant.weight;
    if (normalizedHash < cumulativeWeight) {
      return variant.id;
    }
  }

  // Fallback to control
  return test.variants[0].id;
}
```

### **2. Feature Flag Implementation**

```typescript
// Feature flag system
interface FeatureFlag {
  id: string;
  description: string;
  enabled: boolean;
  rolloutPercentage: number;
  rules: {
    attribute: string;
    operator: "equals" | "contains" | "gt" | "lt" | "in";
    value: any;
  }[];
  variants?: {
    id: string;
    weight: number;
    config: Record<string, any>;
  }[];
}

// Feature flag registry
const featureFlags: Record<string, FeatureFlag> = {
  "new-checkout-flow": {
    id: "new-checkout-flow",
    description: "New streamlined checkout experience",
    enabled: true,
    rolloutPercentage: 25,
    rules: [{ attribute: "userType", operator: "equals", value: "returning" }],
  },
  "dark-mode": {
    id: "dark-mode",
    description: "Dark mode UI theme",
    enabled: true,
    rolloutPercentage: 100,
    rules: [],
    variants: [
      {
        id: "default",
        weight: 80,
        config: {
          backgroundColor: "#1a1a1a",
          textColor: "#ffffff",
        },
      },
      {
        id: "high-contrast",
        weight: 20,
        config: {
          backgroundColor: "#000000",
          textColor: "#ffffff",
        },
      },
    ],
  },
};

// Check if feature is enabled for a user
function isFeatureEnabled(
  featureId: string,
  user: Record<string, any>
): boolean {
  const flag = featureFlags[featureId];

  // Feature doesn't exist or is disabled globally
  if (!flag || !flag.enabled) {
    return false;
  }

  // Check if user matches rules
  if (flag.rules.length > 0) {
    const matchesRules = flag.rules.every((rule) => {
      const userValue = user[rule.attribute];

      switch (rule.operator) {
        case "equals":
          return userValue === rule.value;
        case "contains":
          return userValue?.includes(rule.value);
        case "gt":
          return userValue > rule.value;
        case "lt":
          return userValue < rule.value;
        case "in":
          return rule.value.includes(userValue);
        default:
          return false;
      }
    });

    if (!matchesRules) {
      return false;
    }
  }

  // Check rollout percentage
  const userHash = generateHash(`${user.id}:${featureId}`);
  const normalizedHash = userHash % 100;

  return normalizedHash < flag.rolloutPercentage;
}

// Get feature configuration for a user
function getFeatureConfig(
  featureId: string,
  user: Record<string, any>
): Record<string, any> | null {
  if (!isFeatureEnabled(featureId, user)) {
    return null;
  }

  const flag = featureFlags[featureId];

  // If no variants, return empty config
  if (!flag.variants || flag.variants.length === 0) {
    return {};
  }

  // Assign variant based on weights
  const variantHash = generateHash(`${user.id}:${featureId}:variant`);
  const normalizedHash = variantHash % 100;

  let cumulativeWeight = 0;
  for (const variant of flag.variants) {
    cumulativeWeight += variant.weight;
    if (normalizedHash < cumulativeWeight) {
      return variant.config;
    }
  }

  // Fallback to first variant
  return flag.variants[0].config;
}
```

### **3. Experiment Analysis**

```typescript
// Statistical significance calculator
function calculateStatisticalSignificance(
  controlSize: number,
  controlConversions: number,
  treatmentSize: number,
  treatmentConversions: number,
  confidenceLevel: number = 0.95
): {
  controlRate: number;
  treatmentRate: number;
  absoluteImprovement: number;
  relativeImprovement: number;
  pValue: number;
  isSignificant: boolean;
  confidenceInterval: [number, number];
} {
  // Calculate conversion rates
  const controlRate = controlConversions / controlSize;
  const treatmentRate = treatmentConversions / treatmentSize;

  // Calculate absolute and relative improvements
  const absoluteImprovement = treatmentRate - controlRate;
  const relativeImprovement = (absoluteImprovement / controlRate) * 100;

  // Calculate standard error
  const controlStdErr = Math.sqrt(
    (controlRate * (1 - controlRate)) / controlSize
  );
  const treatmentStdErr = Math.sqrt(
    (treatmentRate * (1 - treatmentRate)) / treatmentSize
  );
  const pooledStdErr = Math.sqrt(
    Math.pow(controlStdErr, 2) + Math.pow(treatmentStdErr, 2)
  );

  // Calculate z-score
  const zScore = absoluteImprovement / pooledStdErr;

  // Calculate p-value
  const pValue = 2 * (1 - normalCDF(Math.abs(zScore)));

  // Calculate confidence interval
  const zCritical = getZCritical(confidenceLevel);
  const marginOfError = zCritical * pooledStdErr;
  const confidenceInterval: [number, number] = [
    absoluteImprovement - marginOfError,
    absoluteImprovement + marginOfError,
  ];

  // Determine if result is statistically significant
  const isSignificant = pValue < 1 - confidenceLevel;

  return {
    controlRate,
    treatmentRate,
    absoluteImprovement,
    relativeImprovement,
    pValue,
    isSignificant,
    confidenceInterval,
  };
}
```
