4. Formatting (adherence to style guidelines)

## Installation Requirements

Role definitions are included in the package installation and are required for the proper functioning of Cortex AI. They should be:

1. Written in English for technical documentation
2. Focused on practical, actionable guidance
3. Regularly updated as domain knowledge evolves
