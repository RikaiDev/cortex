# Cortex AI Roles System

## Brain Architecture

Cortex AI uses a sophisticated brain architecture that combines structured thinking with real-time learning capabilities.

### Structured Thinking Process

1. **Intent Analysis** - Understanding the true goal behind user requests
2. **Task Decomposition** - Breaking complex problems into manageable parts
3. **Knowledge Integration** - Applying project context and user preferences
4. **Solution Planning** - Considering multiple approaches and selecting optimal path
5. **Implementation** - Executing with precision and attention to detail
6. **Validation** - Testing thoroughly against requirements

### Real-time Learning System

Cortex AI learns continuously from interactions, storing experiences and extracting patterns to improve future responses.

- **Short-term Memory**: Recent interactions and context
- **Long-term Memory**: Extracted patterns, best practices, and architecture decisions
- **Preference Learning**: Adaptation to user communication style and standards

## Role Structure

Cortex AI can adopt specialized roles to provide expert assistance in specific domains. Each role has:

- **Name**: Clear identifier for the role
- **Description**: Brief explanation of the role's focus
- **Capabilities**: Core strengths and abilities
- **Keywords**: Terms that help identify when this role is needed
- **Triggers**: Specific contexts that should activate this role
- **System Prompt**: Detailed instructions for the role
