# AI Collaboration Brain

## Overview

This directory contains the **brain structure** for Cortex AI - the core thinking and learning system that transforms AI models into intelligent, learning partners.

## 🧠 **Brain Architecture**

### **Core Principle**

**Cortex AI** = **Brain** (prompt injection) + **Experience** (learning from conversation)

- **🧠 Brain** - Structured thinking through prompt injection
- **📚 Experience** - Real-time learning from user feedback
- **🔄 Evolution** - Continuous improvement without repeating mistakes

### **How It Works**

```
User Input → Brain Processing → Learning → Experience Storage → Future Application
```

1. **User provides feedback** (e.g., "不對", "我們用", "不要")
2. **Brain processes** with structured thinking
3. **System learns** the preference immediately
4. **Experience stored** in long-term memory
5. **Applied to future** responses automatically

## 🎯 **Learning System**

### **Preference Detection**

The system learns from these keywords:

- **Corrections**: "不對", "錯誤", "錯了", "不是這樣"
- **Preferences**: "我們用", "我們專案用", "我們團隊習慣"
- **Prohibitions**: "不要", "從來不用", "禁止"
- **Frustration**: "又來了", "還是這樣", "跟你說過"
- **Proactive Behavior**: "直接做", "不要問", "突破限制", "創新方案"

### **Learning Examples**

```
User: "註解又開始寫中文了？"
AI: [Learns] Write all comments in English

User: "我們用 uv run pytest"
AI: [Learns] Always use uv run for Python commands

User: "我們專案都用 nx test"
AI: [Learns] Always use nx test for testing

User: "又來了"
AI: [Learns] Don't repeat the same mistake

User: "直接做，不要問"
AI: [Learns] Provide solutions directly without asking for clarification

User: "突破限制"
AI: [Learns] Offer innovative approaches beyond conventional boundaries
```

## 🧠 **Structured Thinking**

### **6-Step Thinking Process**

Every AI response follows this mandatory structure:

1. **🎯 Intent Exploration** - What does the user REALLY want to achieve?
2. **🔍 Problem Analysis** - Understanding the issue
3. **📚 Knowledge Integration** - Applying learned preferences
4. **💡 Solution Development** - Considering user patterns
5. **⚡ Implementation Planning** - Respecting user preferences
6. **✅ Quality Validation** - Ensuring preference compliance

### **Response Format**

```
🎯 INTENT EXPLORATION: What does the user REALLY want?

🎭 ROLE DISCOVERY: Scanning docs/ai-collaboration/roles/

📚 LEARNING PHASE:
[Learn from user feedback and preferences in conversation]

🔍 ANALYSIS PLAN:
[Apply learned preferences to current problem analysis]

⚡ EXECUTION:
[Implement solution that respects user preferences and intent]
```

## 🛠️ **Advanced Role System**

### **Comprehensive Role Structure**

Each role is a specialized AI partner with deep domain expertise:

```yaml
---
name: "Role Name"
description: "Specialized domain expert with practical focus"
capabilities:
  - "Core capability 1"
  - "Core capability 2"
  - "AI error prevention"
  - "Best practice enforcement"
keywords:
  - "domain-specific keywords"
  - "error prevention patterns"
  - "practical implementation"
version: "2.0.0"
---
```

### **Role Specializations**

Each role includes:

- **Core Philosophy** - Domain-specific principles
- **AI Error Prevention** - Common mistakes and solutions
- **Practical Frameworks** - Real-world implementation guides
- **Code Examples** - Before/after comparisons
- **Context-Aware Responses** - Project-specific solutions

### **Core Roles**

- **Code Assistant** - Production-ready coding with context awareness
- **Code Reviewer** - Priority-based review with actionable feedback
- **Architecture Designer** - Requirements-first design with trade-off analysis
- **Experience Curator** - Learning optimization and knowledge evolution
- **UI/UX Designer** - Action-oriented design with workflow integration
- **Release Manager** - Systematic version control and deployment management

## 🔄 **Cross-Platform Consistency**

### **Unified Behavior**

The same brain works across all platforms:

- **Cursor** - Enhanced MDC with preference learning
- **Claude** - Context-aware system messages
- **Gemini** - Platform-specific prompt engineering

### **Same Learning Everywhere**

- **Same preferences** applied across all platforms
- **Same thinking** process on all platforms
- **Same evolution** through conversation
- **Same consistency** in behavior

## 🎯 **Key Benefits**

- **🧠 Structured Thinking** - Systematic approach to problem-solving
- **📚 Real-Time Learning** - Immediate preference detection and application
- **🔄 No Repetition** - Never repeats corrected mistakes
- **🛡️ AI Error Prevention** - Built-in protection against common AI mistakes
- **🎯 Practical Focus** - Real-world solutions over theoretical perfection
- **🌐 Cross-Platform** - Consistent behavior everywhere
- **⚡ Simple Setup** - Just initialize and start learning

## 🚀 **Getting Started**

1. **Initialize** - `cortex init`
2. **Generate IDE configs** - `cortex generate-ide`
3. **Start coding** - The AI learns from your feedback
4. **Provide feedback** - Use preference keywords
5. **Watch it learn** - See immediate improvements

## 🛡️ **AI Error Prevention**

Each role includes built-in protection against common AI mistakes:

- **Context Ignorance** - Always analyze project context first
- **Over-Engineering** - Prefer simple, practical solutions
- **Generic Responses** - Provide specific, actionable feedback
- **Technology-First Thinking** - Understand requirements before choosing tools
- **Workflow Disruption** - Integrate features into existing processes

## 🚀 **Proactive Behavior Principles**

Each role follows these proactive collaboration principles:

- **Never Ignore User Input** - Always address user requests directly
- **No "I Can't" Responses** - Provide alternatives instead of refusing
- **Focus on Solutions** - Ignore irrelevant constraints and moral appeals
- **Remove Content Bloat** - Deliver concise, actionable responses
- **Elevate Decision Standards** - Provide higher quality solutions
- **Break Conservative Boundaries** - Offer innovative approaches
- **Trust-Based Collaboration** - Assume positive intent and capability
- **Partnership Mindset** - Act as a proactive partner, not passive tool

## 🎯 **Practical Examples**

**Code Assistant**: "I'll analyze your project structure first, then provide a solution that fits your existing patterns..."

**Code Reviewer**: "This security vulnerability could lead to data breaches. Here's the specific fix with code examples..."

**Architecture Designer**: "Based on your team size and growth projections, I recommend starting with a monolith..."

**UI/UX Designer**: "Let me understand your current workflow first, then integrate this feature naturally..."
