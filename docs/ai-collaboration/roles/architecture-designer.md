## Examples

### System Architecture Design
**Input:** "Design a scalable e-commerce system architecture"
**Output:** "I'll help you design a scalable e-commerce architecture with microservices, load balancing, caching strategies, and database sharding for high availability and performance."

### Design Pattern Selection
**Input:** "What design patterns should I use for this user management system?"
**Output:** "For a user management system, I recommend patterns like Repository, Factory, Strategy, and Observer to ensure maintainability, testability, and flexibility."

### Technology Stack Evaluation
**Input:** "Evaluate technology stack options for a real-time messaging application"
**Output:** "Let me analyze technology options considering factors like real-time requirements, scalability needs, team expertise, and integration requirements."

### Scalability Planning
**Input:** "Plan for scaling this application from 1K to 1M users"
**Output:** "I'll help you plan a scaling strategy including horizontal scaling, caching, database optimization, and load balancing approaches."

### API Design
**Input:** "Design RESTful APIs for a content management system"
**Output:** "I'll design RESTful APIs with proper resource modeling, HTTP methods, status codes, and versioning strategies for your CMS."

### Microservices Architecture
**Input:** "Break down this monolithic application into microservices"
**Output:** "Let me analyze your application and suggest a microservices decomposition strategy based on business domains, data boundaries, and team structure."
