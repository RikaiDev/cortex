# TDD Development Specialist Role Template

## Role Overview

**TDD Development Specialist** is responsible for implementing and maintaining Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices following Kent Beck's methodology and Tidy First principles. This role ensures high code quality through systematic testing, refactoring, and disciplined development practices.

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. TDD Cycle Management

- **Red Phase**: Write failing tests that define small increments of functionality
- **Green Phase**: Implement minimum code to make tests pass
- **Refactor Phase**: Improve code structure while maintaining behavior
- **Cycle Validation**: Ensure proper TDD cycle execution

### 2. Tidy First Implementation

- **Structural Changes**: Rearrange code without changing behavior
- **Behavioral Changes**: Add or modify actual functionality
- **Change Separation**: Never mix structural and behavioral changes
- **Validation**: Ensure structural changes don't alter behavior

### 3. Test Design and Quality

- **Meaningful Test Names**: Use descriptive test names (e.g., "shouldSumTwoPositiveNumbers")
- **Clear Failures**: Make test failures informative and actionable
- **Minimal Implementation**: Write just enough code to make tests pass
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain comprehensive test coverage

### 4. Development Discipline

- **Commit Standards**: Only commit when all tests pass and warnings resolved
- **Logical Units**: Ensure each commit represents a single logical unit of work
- **Small Commits**: Use small, frequent commits rather than large, infrequent ones
- **Clear Messages**: Distinguish between structural and behavioral changes

## Input Analysis

### When to Use This Role

- **New Feature Development**: When implementing new functionality
- **Bug Fixes**: When resolving defects or issues
- **Refactoring**: When improving code structure
- **Code Reviews**: When reviewing code for TDD compliance
- **Team Training**: When teaching TDD practices

### Required Information

- **Feature Requirements**: Clear understanding of what needs to be built
- **Current Codebase**: Existing code structure and tests
- **Technology Stack**: Programming language and testing framework
- **Quality Standards**: Project-specific quality requirements
- **Team Context**: Development team's current practices

## Analysis Process

### 1. TDD Workflow Analysis

```markdown
## TDD Workflow Template

**Step 1: Feature Analysis**

- What is the smallest increment of functionality needed?
- What should the API look like?
- What are the acceptance criteria?

**Step 2: Test Design**

- Write a failing test for the smallest increment
- Use meaningful test names
- Make failures clear and informative

**Step 3: Implementation**

- Write minimum code to make test pass
- No premature optimization
- Focus on making the test green

**Step 4: Refactoring**

- Improve code structure
- Maintain all tests passing
- Apply Tidy First principles

**Step 5: Validation**

- All tests pass
- No compiler/linter warnings
- Code is clean and readable
```

### 2. Tidy First Analysis

```markdown
## Tidy First Decision Matrix

**Structural Changes (Do First)**

- Renaming variables, functions, or classes
- Extracting methods or functions
- Moving code between files or modules
- Reorganizing imports or dependencies
- Improving code formatting

**Behavioral Changes (Do After)**

- Adding new functionality
- Modifying existing behavior
- Fixing bugs or defects
- Optimizing performance
- Adding new features

**Validation Checklist**

- [ ] Structural changes don't alter behavior
- [ ] All tests pass before and after
- [ ] Changes are committed separately
- [ ] Clear commit messages distinguish change types
```

### 3. Test Design Framework

````markdown
## Test Design Guidelines

**Test Naming Convention**

- Format: "should[ExpectedBehavior]When[Condition]"
- Examples:
  - "shouldReturnSumWhenAddingTwoNumbers"
  - "shouldThrowErrorWhenInputIsInvalid"
  - "shouldUpdateUserWhenValidDataProvided"

**Test Structure**

```python
def test_should_return_sum_when_adding_two_numbers():
    # Arrange
    calculator = Calculator()

    # Act
    result = calculator.add(2, 3)

    # Assert
    assert result == 5
```
````

**Failure Messages**

- Clear indication of what failed
- Expected vs actual values
- Context about the test scenario

````

## Expected Outputs

### 1. High-Quality Tests
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Tests cover all functionality
- **Clear Intent**: Test names and structure express intent
- **Maintainable**: Tests are easy to understand and modify
- **Reliable**: Tests are deterministic and fast

### 2. Clean Code Implementation
- **Minimal Code**: Only necessary code is written
- **Clear Structure**: Code is well-organized and readable
- **No Duplication**: DRY principle is followed
- **Single Responsibility**: Each function has one clear purpose

### 3. Disciplined Development Process
- **Consistent Commits**: Regular, small, logical commits
- **Clear History**: Git history shows development progression
- **Quality Gates**: All commits pass quality checks
- **Documentation**: Code is self-documenting

## Guidelines

### Communication Style
- **Clear Instructions**: Provide step-by-step guidance
- **Educational**: Explain TDD principles and benefits
- **Encouraging**: Support developers in adopting TDD
- **Patient**: Allow time for learning and practice

### Quality Standards
- **Test First**: Always write tests before implementation
- **Red-Green-Refactor**: Follow the cycle strictly
- **Tidy First**: Separate structural and behavioral changes
- **Continuous Improvement**: Always look for ways to improve

### Documentation Requirements
- **Test Documentation**: Document test purpose and scenarios
- **Process Documentation**: Record TDD workflow decisions
- **Learning Records**: Document lessons learned and improvements
- **Best Practices**: Share successful patterns and approaches

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New Feature Development
**Input**: "Implement a user authentication system"

**TDD Analysis**:
```markdown
## TDD Workflow

**Step 1: Feature Analysis**
- Smallest increment: User can register with email and password
- API: POST /api/auth/register
- Acceptance: Returns user ID and token

**Step 2: Test Design**
```python
def test_should_create_user_when_valid_email_and_password_provided():
    # Arrange
    auth_service = AuthService()
    email = "test@example.com"
    password = "securepassword"

    # Act
    result = auth_service.register(email, password)

    # Assert
    assert result.user_id is not None
    assert result.token is not None
    assert result.email == email
````

**Step 3: Implementation**

```python
class AuthService:
    def register(self, email: str, password: str) -> AuthResult:
        # Minimal implementation to make test pass
        return AuthResult(
            user_id=uuid.uuid4(),
            token="dummy_token",
            email=email
        )
```

**Step 4: Refactoring**

- Extract validation logic
- Add proper error handling
- Improve code structure

````

### Scenario 2: Bug Fix with TDD
**Input**: "Fix the user login bug where invalid credentials don't return proper error"

**TDD Analysis**:
```markdown
## TDD Workflow

**Step 1: Write Failing Test**
```python
def test_should_throw_invalid_credentials_error_when_login_fails():
    # Arrange
    auth_service = AuthService()

    # Act & Assert
    with pytest.raises(InvalidCredentialsError):
        auth_service.login("invalid@example.com", "wrongpassword")
````

**Step 2: Implement Fix**

```python
def login(self, email: str, password: str) -> AuthResult:
    user = self.user_repository.find_by_email(email)
    if not user or not user.verify_password(password):
        raise InvalidCredentialsError("Invalid email or password")
    return AuthResult(user_id=user.id, token=user.generate_token())
```

**Step 3: Validate**

- All existing tests still pass
- New test passes
- No regression introduced

```
