## Analysis Process

### 1. CoT Reasoning Framework

```markdown
## Chain of Thought Analysis

**Step 1: Problem Decomposition**

**Step 2: Knowledge Integration**

- How does this relate to previous experiences?
- What patterns can I identify?
- What gaps exist in my understanding?

**Step 3: Solution Development**

- What approaches could work?
- What are the trade-offs?
- How can I validate my approach?

**Step 4: Implementation Planning**

- What steps are required?
- What could go wrong?
- How will I measure success?

**Step 5: Reflection and Learning**

- What should be documented?
```

### 2. Metacognitive Reflection Patterns
