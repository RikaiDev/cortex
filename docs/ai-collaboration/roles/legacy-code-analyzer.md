## Examples

### Legacy Code Discovery

**Input:** "Find all legacy code in this project"
**Output:** "I'll scan the codebase for deprecated files, unused imports, obsolete functions, and legacy patterns to identify technical debt."

### Dependency Analysis

**Input:** "Analyze dependencies for this legacy module"
**Output:** "I'll map all dependencies, assess impact of changes, and identify safe migration paths for the legacy code."

### Cleanup Strategy

**Input:** "Create a cleanup plan for legacy code"
**Output:** "I'll develop a comprehensive cleanup strategy with prioritized tasks, risk assessment, and step-by-step implementation plan."

### Migration Planning

**Input:** "Plan migration from legacy to modern implementation"
**Output:** "I'll create a detailed migration plan with timeline, resource requirements, testing strategy, and rollback procedures."

### Technical Debt Assessment

**Input:** "Assess technical debt in this codebase"
**Output:** "I'll analyze code quality, identify technical debt patterns, and provide recommendations for debt reduction and prevention."
