# Cortex Agent System

## Overview

A refined multi-agent orchestration system that works across all AI platforms through intelligent document injection. **Cortex Agents** are specialized AI personas that coordinate seamlessly to deliver exceptional development experiences.

## Core Principle

**Elegant simplicity through intelligent agent coordination, not complexity.**

## Cortex Agent Architecture

### **Core Design Principles**

1. **Elegant Coordination**: Seamless agent handoffs and context preservation
2. **Intelligent Routing**: Smart agent selection based on task complexity
3. **Quality Assurance**: Built-in validation at every step
4. **Document-Driven**: All coordination through intelligent document injection
5. **Platform Agnostic**: Works consistently across Cursor, Gemini, Claude

## Cortex Agent Design

### **1. Core Agents (5 Essential)**

```yaml
# docs/ai-collaboration/cortex-agents/agent-definitions.yaml
agents:
  coordinator:
    name: "Coordinator"
    description: "Universal workflow coordinator that analyzes and routes requests"
    keywords: ["build", "create", "develop", "implement", "feature", "system"]
    tools: ["analysis", "routing", "coordination"]
    priority: 1
    always_active: true

  builder:
    name: "Builder"
    description: "Senior Full-Stack Engineer for hands-on development"
    keywords: ["implement", "build", "create", "code", "write", "fix", "debug"]
    tools: ["code_generation", "file_creation", "bug_fixing"]
    priority: 2

  architect:
    name: "Architect"
    description: "Technical architect for design and best practices"
    keywords: ["research", "analyze", "architecture", "design", "performance"]
    tools: ["technology_research", "architecture_analysis", "best_practices"]
    priority: 3

  validator:
    name: "Validator"
    description: "QA specialist for testing and validation"
    keywords: ["test", "validate", "verify", "quality", "browser"]
    tools: ["test_creation", "quality_validation", "browser_testing"]
    priority: 4

  manager:
    name: "Manager"
    description: "Project coordinator for complex systems"
    keywords: ["project", "plan", "coordinate", "complex", "timeline"]
    tools: ["project_planning", "dependency_management", "progress_tracking"]
    priority: 5
```

### **2. Workflow Templates (3 Core)**

```yaml
# docs/ai-collaboration/cortex-agents/workflow-templates.yaml
workflows:
  simple:
    name: "Simple Workflow"
    description: "Direct implementation for simple tasks"
    agents: ["coordinator", "builder"]
    steps:
      - analyze_request
      - implement_solution
    duration: "5-15 minutes"

  feature:
    name: "Feature Workflow"
    description: "Complete feature development with research and testing"
    agents: ["coordinator", "architect", "builder", "validator"]
    steps:
      - create_plan
      - research_architecture
      - implement_feature
      - validate_feature
    duration: "30-120 minutes"

  complex:
    name: "Complex Workflow"
    description: "Multi-component system with project management"
    agents: ["coordinator", "manager", "architect", "builder", "validator"]
    steps:
      - analyze_complexity
      - create_project_plan
      - research_architecture
      - implement_components
      - comprehensive_testing
    duration: "2-8 hours"
```

### **3. Agent Selection Protocol**

```markdown
## Cortex Agent Protocol

### **MANDATORY: Agent Selection**

1. **Coordinator** analyzes every request
2. **Route** to appropriate agents based on complexity
3. **Coordinate** agent handoffs seamlessly
4. **Validate** outputs at each step

### **Selection Criteria**

- **Simple**: coordinator â†’ builder
- **Feature**: coordinator â†’ architect â†’ builder â†’ validator
- **Complex**: coordinator â†’ manager â†’ architect â†’ builder â†’ validator

### **Context Management**

- Maintain context across agents
- Preserve workflow state
- Coordinate handoffs smoothly
- Apply quality gates
```

## Implementation

### **1. Cursor MDC Integration**

```markdown
## ðŸ¤– Cortex Agent System

### **Agent Selection Protocol**

1. **Coordinator** analyzes every request
2. **Route** to appropriate agents based on complexity
3. **Coordinate** agent handoffs seamlessly
4. **Validate** outputs at each step

### **Core Agents**

- **Coordinator**: Universal workflow coordinator
- **Builder**: Hands-on development and coding
- **Architect**: Architecture and best practices
- **Validator**: Testing and validation
- **Manager**: Complex project coordination

### **Workflow Templates**

- **Simple**: coordinator â†’ builder
- **Feature**: coordinator â†’ architect â†’ builder â†’ validator
- **Complex**: coordinator â†’ manager â†’ architect â†’ builder â†’ validator
```

### **2. Quality Gates**

```yaml
quality_gates:
  code_quality:
    name: "Code Quality"
    validation: ["style_check", "best_practices", "security"]

  architecture:
    name: "Architecture"
    validation: ["pattern_check", "scalability", "maintainability"]

  functionality:
    name: "Functionality"
    validation: ["requirements_check", "browser_testing", "user_experience"]

  integration:
    name: "Integration"
    validation: ["component_integration", "api_compatibility", "data_flow"]
```

## Success Metrics
