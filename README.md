## 🧠 AI Collaboration Brain

**Cortex AI** is an intelligent AI collaboration system that transforms AI models into reliable, learning partners. It solves the fundamental problems of AI inconsistency and lack of memory through **prompt injection** and **real-time preference learning**.

### 🎯 **Core Mission**

To create consistent, personalized, and continuously improving AI collaboration experiences that adapt to individual developers and project needs, eliminating the frustration of repetitive explanations and inconsistent AI behavior.

### 🎯 **Why Cortex?**

**The Problem:**

- AI models behave inconsistently across different platforms
- AI forgets user preferences and coding patterns
- Repetitive explanations of the same project conventions
- Lack of personalization in AI collaboration
- No memory of successful interaction patterns

**The Solution:**

- **🧠 Consistent AI Behavior** - Standardized thinking processes across all AI platforms
- **📚 Learning Memory** - Remembers user preferences and project patterns
- **🔄 Continuous Adaptation** - Evolves based on successful interactions
- **🎯 Context Awareness** - Understands project-specific conventions and workflows

### 🧠 **Core Principles**

**Cortex AI** implements proven principles for reliable AI collaboration:

1. **Few-Shot to Fine-Tune Transformation** - We transform simple few-shot examples into comprehensive fine-tune prompts automatically, eliminating the need for manual prompt engineering.

2. **Hook-Based Interception System** - Our architecture intercepts all user inputs and processes them through a structured pipeline that guarantees consistent quality and behavior.

3. **Deterministic Expansion Over Randomness** - Rather than relying on emergent behaviors, we systematically expand minimal user inputs into complete, well-structured instructions.

4. **Guaranteed Processing Pipeline** - Every user input is processed through our complete pipeline with 100% execution rate, ensuring no step is ever skipped.

5. **Explicit Reasoning and Documentation** - All transformations from few-shot to fine-tune are explicit, documented, and traceable through our workflow.

This philosophy drives our implementation of an intelligent system that transforms simple user inputs (few-shot examples) into comprehensive, production-ready fine-tune prompts through mandatory processing steps.

## ✨ **Core Features**

### **🧠 Structured Thinking**

- **6-Step Thinking Process**: Intent Exploration → Problem Analysis → Knowledge Integration → Solution Development → Implementation Planning → Quality Validation
- **Mandatory Protocol**: Forces AI to think systematically, regardless of model capabilities
- **Quality Validation**: Ensures complete and logical thinking

### **📚 Real-Time Learning**

- **User Preference Detection**: Learns from keywords like "wrong", "we use", "don't"
- **Immediate Application**: Applies learned preferences to current response
- **No Repetition**: Never repeats corrected mistakes
- **Frustration Detection**: Recognizes and learns from user frustration

### **🔄 Cross-Platform Consistency**

- **Cursor Integration**: Enhanced MDC with preference learning
- **Claude Support**: Context-aware system messages
- **Gemini Support**: Platform-specific prompt engineering
- **Unified Behavior**: Same learning and thinking across all platforms

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

### **Installation**

```bash
# Direct execution via npx (recommended)
npx @rikaidev/cortex@latest

# Or global installation
npm install -g @rikaidev/cortex
```

> **Note**: Using `@rikaidev/cortex@latest` ensures you always get the latest version without manual updates.

### **MCP Client Configuration**

Add the following config to your MCP client:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cortex-ai": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@rikaidev/cortex@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### **Supported MCP Clients**

#### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add cortex-ai npx @rikaidev/cortex@latest
```

#### Cursor

- Go to `Cursor Settings` → `MCP` → `New MCP Server`
- Use the config provided above

#### VS Code

```bash
code --add-mcp '{"name":"cortex-ai","command":"npx","args":["@rikaidev/cortex@latest"]}'
```

#### Copilot CLI

```bash
copilot
/mcp add
# Server name: cortex-ai
# Command: npx
# Arguments: -y, @rikaidev/cortex@latest
```

### **Initialize Project**

```bash
# Generate IDE configurations
npx @rikaidev/cortex@latest generate-ide
```

### **Initialize MCP Workspace** (Recommended)

For the latest Multi-Role Pattern workflow features:

```bash
# Initialize Cortex MCP workspace structure
npx @rikaidev/cortex@latest mcp init

# Start MCP server for workflow management
npx @rikaidev/cortex@latest mcp start

# Run workflow demo to see Multi-Role Pattern in action
node examples/integrated-multi-role-demo.js
```

The new MCP approach creates isolated workspaces for each workflow:

```text
.cortex/
├── .cortexrc              # Configuration file
├── workflows/             # Workflow state files
├── workspaces/            # Individual workspace folders (hash-based)
│   └── abc12345/          # Unique workspace for each workflow
│       ├── handoff.md     # Role handoff documentation
│       └── pr.md          # Pull request description
└── roles/                 # Role definitions
```

### **Start Learning**

```bash
# Start AI collaboration
npx @rikaidev/cortex@latest start

# Show version
npx @rikaidev/cortex@latest version
```

## 🎯 **How It Works**

### **1. Learning from Conversation**

```text
User: "Comments are in Chinese again?"
AI: [Learns] Write all comments in English
User: "we use uv run pytest"
AI: [Learns] Always use uv run for Python commands
User: "again"
AI: [Learns] Don't repeat the same mistake
```

### **2. Structured Thinking**

```text
🔍 ANALYSIS PHASE: [Problem understanding]
📚 KNOWLEDGE INTEGRATION: [Apply learned preferences]
💡 SOLUTION DEVELOPMENT: [Consider user preferences]
⚡ IMPLEMENTATION PLAN: [Respect user patterns]
✅ QUALITY VALIDATION: [Ensure preference compliance]
```

### **3. Cross-Platform Consistency**

- **Same learning** across Cursor, Claude, and Gemini
- **Same thinking** process on all platforms
- **Same preferences** applied everywhere
- **Same evolution** through conversation

## 🎯 **Why "Cortex"?**

**Cortex (大腦皮質)** represents the brain's advanced cognitive functions:

- **🧠 Thinking** - Structured reasoning and problem-solving
- **📚 Memory** - Learning and storing experiences
- **🔄 Evolution** - Continuous improvement through experience
- **🎯 Decision** - Making informed choices based on learning

Just like the human cerebral cortex, **Cortex AI** is the "brain" for AI systems - responsible for thinking, memory, learning, and decision-making.
